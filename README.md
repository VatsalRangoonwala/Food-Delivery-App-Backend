# Food-Delivery-App-Backend
- My 15 days of internship project
- This project implements a RESTful Web API backend for a food delivery application. Built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, it handles core functionalities such as user authentication, restaurant and menu management, order placement, real-time order tracking, and payment integration. The API ensures secure data handling with JWT-based authentication and follows modular coding practices for scalability and maintainability. This backend serves as the foundation for mobile or web frontends, enabling a seamless and efficient food delivery experience.
